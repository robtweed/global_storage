# About this Repository

This repository provides background information on the little-known but incredibly powerful database
architecture known as *Global Storage*:

- what it is and how it works
- what it makes possible and therefore why you should be interested in it.  In other words, the *so what?*
about Global Storage databases.  In summary it's something we refer to as *Universal NoSQL*
- an introduction to QEWD-JSdb: persistent Node.js/JavaScript Objects, made possible with Global Storage
- implementations: native implementations and abstractions layered on top of other databases
- some performance comparisons that we've carried out

The last point has turned out to be interesting, providing evidence that the two main native Global Storage databases are the fastest database technologies on the planet, and by a significant margin.  Don't believe it?  Then please read the articles in this repository, and try out our comparisons for yourself.
