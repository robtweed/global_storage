# Key/Value Storage using Globals

Implementing basic Key/Value storage is very simple with Global Storage.  It's simply a matter of using this very basic Global Structure:

        keyValueStore[key] = value


For example:

        telephone["211-555-9012"] = "James, George"
        telephone["617-555-1414"] = "Tweed, Rob" 

Viewed diagrammatically, this set of key/value pairs would look like this within a Global:
